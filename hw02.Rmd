We use Râ€™s built-in dataset, PlantGrowth (you could use help(PlantGrowth) for details about this dataset). There are three groups of plant weight data from an experiment consisting of 2 treatments (trt1 and trt2) and 1 control group (ctr1). Use two testing methods (not limited to the methods covered in class) to test if and how the two treatments are different from the control.

```{r}
data(PlantGrowth)
head(PlantGrowth)

```
